Using the Pandas library, load a CSV file and perform basic data analysis tasks, such as 
calculating the average of a selected column. Additionally, use Matplotlib to create 
visualizations, including bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps, to analyze the data. Provide 
insights and observations based on the analysis and visualizations.  

Develop a linear regression model to predict house price based on features such as the 
number of rooms, location, size and other relevant factors. Collect a suitable dataset from 
Kaggle, preprocess it, and train the model to make accurate predictions.  

Create a "Matrix Operations Tool" using Python and the NumPy library. The application should 
allow users to input matrices and perform operations like addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, transpose, and determinant calculation. Include an interactive interface to 
display results in a structured format.
